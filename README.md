## Overview

This project is designed as a small internal **AI Knowledge Assistant** that helps technical teams search documents, store notes, retrieve information, and call different tools through a single agent. The system uses a **modular**, 
**MCP‑inspired design with a GraphQL API**, a **tool‑using agent**, and a **distributed‑ready fine‑tuning** setup. It’s meant to represent how modern AI platforms structure internal assistants for engineering and research teams.
